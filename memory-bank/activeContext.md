# Android-Spoof Current Active Context

## Project Status
Android-Spoof is currently in the early stage of development, focusing primarily on analysis, research, and architecture design. Based on the goals and roadmap set out, the project is in Phase 1: Research and Prototype.

### Progress Summary
- ‚úÖ Collected and analyzed related projects (XPL-EX, PlayIntegrityFix, TrickyStore, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Designed overall system architecture
- ‚úÖ Set up repository and project structure
- üîÑ Currently analyzing LineageOS source code in more depth
- üîÑ Currently building POCs for key modules
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Not yet started developing DeviceSpoofService
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Not yet started modifying system source code

## Current Tasks and Priorities

### Short-term Priorities (Current Sprint)
1. **Complete LineageOS source code analysis** focusing on:
   - Classes handling device information (`Build.java`, `SystemProperties.java`)
   - Telephony API (IMEI, IMSI)
   - Certificate system and KeyStore

2. **Build POC for DeviceSpoofService**:
   - Develop prototype service for device information management
   - Test device profile mechanism
   - Verify system information override method

3. **Research key attestation bypass methods**:
   - Analyze TrickyStore operating mechanism
   - Understand how certificate chains are created and verified
   - Build POC for key attestation spoofing

### Detailed Technical Tasks
- Analyze the structure of the `android.os.Build` class and how it's used in the system
- Identify optimal intervention points for overriding device information
- Research how to create and register a new system service in LineageOS
- Build JSON data model for device profiles
- Create test environment to verify the effectiveness of spoofing techniques

## Pending Decisions

### Decisions to be Made
1. **Priority integration method**:
   - Focus on complete LineageOS integration
   - Or develop hybrid integration method for stock ROMs
   - Or pursue both methods in parallel

2. **Consistency management strategy**:
   - Focus on modifying original classes
   - Or build a layer to intercept API calls through dynamic proxy
   - Or combine both methods

3. **Key attestation approach**:
   - Use the simpler Leaf Hack method
   - Or implement the more complex but flexible Certificate Generating Mode

## Current Challenges and Risks

### Technical Challenges
1. **Ensuring API coverage**:
   - Large number of APIs need to be overridden or modified
   - Difficulty in identifying all APIs that need to be handled

2. **Bypassing Play Integrity effectively**:
   - Google frequently updates verification mechanisms
   - Spoofing method needs to be flexible enough to adapt

3. **System stability**:
   - Ensuring modifications don't cause crashes or affect stability
   - Handling compatibility with different Android versions

### Risks
1. **Detection capability**:
   - Applications are increasingly sophisticated in detecting spoofing
   - Need to ensure consistency at all levels

2. **Continuous Android updates**:
   - Google releases regular updates that may affect the project
   - Need a strategy to keep up with changes

## Current Resources and Research

### Documentation Being Used
- Source code of reference projects (XPL-EX, PlayIntegrityFix, etc.)
- AOSP and LineageOS documentation
- Technical analysis of Play Integrity mechanism

### Tools Being Used
- IDE: Android Studio, VSCode
- Analysis: jadx, apktool
- Testing: frida, objection
- Source code management: git, repo

## Next Steps

### This Week
- Complete basic analysis of LineageOS source code
- Create detailed diagrams of data flow and component interactions
- Build first POC for Core Service

### Next Month
- Complete Phase 1 (Research and Prototype)
- Begin Phase 2 (Core Services Development)
- Implement basic DeviceSpoofService
- Develop device profile management mechanism
