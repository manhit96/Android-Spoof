# Android-Spoof Project Progress

## Progress Overview
The Android-Spoof project is currently in Phase 1 (Research and Prototype) of a 5-phase development roadmap. We have completed the analysis of related projects, designed the overall architecture, and set up the repository. Currently, we are focusing on deeper analysis of LineageOS source code and building POCs for key modules.
