# Android-Spoof - Project Brief

## Overview
Android-Spoof is a project developing a comprehensive solution for Android device information spoofing integrated directly into LineageOS source code, rather than using hooks like Xposed, to create a more robust and consistent system.

## Key Objectives
- Develop a comprehensive Android device information spoofing solution
- Integrate directly into LineageOS source code instead of using hooks (Xposed)
- Create a system capable of completely spoofing a new device (brand, model, IMEI, MAC, etc.)
- Ensure consistency of all information to create a valid fingerprint
- Bypass verification mechanisms such as Google Play Integrity and SafetyNet

## Project Scope
The project focuses on integrating spoofing techniques into the LineageOS operating system, with two main approaches:
1. **Direct Integration into LineageOS**: Modifying the original LineageOS source code to integrate spoofing mechanisms
2. **Integration into Stock ROMs through Reverse Engineering**: Developing methods to apply to manufacturer stock ROMs

## Value Proposition
- Comprehensive spoofing solution that bypasses advanced security checks
- Increased privacy for Android users
- Ability to customize device information through easily manageable profiles
- Deep system integration providing stable and consistent experience
