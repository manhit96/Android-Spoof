# Android-Spoof Product Context

## Problem Statement
The Android operating system is becoming increasingly stringent in implementing device integrity and verification mechanisms. These mechanisms include Google Play Integrity, SafetyNet, and Key Attestation, designed to:
- Prevent rooted or modified devices from using certain sensitive applications (such as banking, payment)
- Limit user control and customization of their devices
- Collect device identification information for advertising targeting and tracking purposes

Users with needs for privacy, security, and freedom to use their devices as they wish require a comprehensive solution to:
1. Control personal and device information they share
2. Overcome limitations imposed on customized devices
3. Fully use applications and services without restrictions

## Product Vision
Android-Spoof aims to provide a comprehensive solution, deeply integrated into the system to spoof Android device information consistently and effectively, while bypassing integrity verification mechanisms from Google and other developers.

The product will allow users to:
- Completely spoof device identity (brand, model, serial number, IMEI...)
- Retain control over their personal data
- Use custom ROMs like LineageOS while still having full access to applications
- Maintain high security through system-level integration instead of unstable hooks

## Target Users
1. **Custom ROM Users**: People using LineageOS and other custom ROMs who want full access to Google services and sensitive applications
2. **Privacy-conscious Users**: People who want to limit device information shared with services and applications
3. **Developers and Testers**: People who need to test applications on various device configurations
4. **Security Experts**: People researching security mechanisms and device authentication

## User Experience
The Android-Spoof user experience will be:
- **Seamlessly Integrated**: Working as part of the system, not requiring complex third-party applications
- **Simple Management**: Easy-to-use management interface for adjusting spoof configuration
- **Consistent Operation**: Ensuring all device information is consistent, avoiding detection
- **Automated**: Automatically updating device information from the latest Pixel models
- **Highly Reliable**: Passing MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY level checks without interruption

## Key Features
1. Device profile management system
2. Comprehensive hardware and software information spoofing
3. Key attestation spoofing mechanism
4. Keybox rotation and automatic updates support
5. SELinux and bootloader status management
6. Consistent fingerprint information assurance
7. Configuration management tool with user interface
