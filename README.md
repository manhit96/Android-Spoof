# Android-Spoof

A comprehensive Android device information spoofing solution integrated directly into LineageOS source code instead of using hooks like Xposed.

[English](README.md) | [Tiếng Việt](README_vi.md)

## Overview

Android-Spoof develops a solution to spoof Android device information through direct integration into LineageOS source code, creating a more stable and consistent system compared to existing hook-based solutions.

> **Note**: This project is maintained as a private research initiative and is not intended for public distribution or open-source release.

## Objectives

- Develop a comprehensive Android device information spoofing solution
- Integrate directly into LineageOS source code instead of using hooks (Xposed)
- Create a system capable of completely spoofing a device (brand, model, IMEI, MAC, etc.)
- Ensure consistency of all information to create valid fingerprints
- Bypass verification mechanisms such as Google Play Integrity and SafetyNet
- Research security mechanisms and system integrity verification methods

## Project Status

The project is currently in the **research phase**. We are focusing on analyzing existing projects and studying LineageOS source code to determine the optimal integration approach.

## Project Documentation

To understand and contribute to this project, we recommend familiarizing yourself with our documentation in the following order:

### Memory Bank Documentation (Recommended Reading Order)
The Memory Bank contains the most up-to-date project context and information:

1. [Project Brief](memory-bank/projectbrief.md) - Core project overview and goals
2. [Product Context](memory-bank/productContext.md) - Problem statement and user experience vision
3. [System Patterns](memory-bank/systemPatterns.md) - System architecture and key components
4. [Technical Context](memory-bank/techContext.md) - Technical details and development environment
5. [Active Context](memory-bank/activeContext.md) - Current work focus and ongoing decisions
6. [Progress](memory-bank/progress.md) - Project progress status and upcoming milestones

### Technical Analysis Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains in-depth analyses of relevant projects and technologies:

- [Comprehensive Android Device Spoofing Analysis](docs/android_device_spoofing_comprehensive_analysis.md) - Overview of device spoofing technologies
- [XPL-EX Analysis](docs/XPL-EX_Analysis.md) - Analysis of XPL-EX architecture and methods
- [PlayIntegrityFix Analysis](docs/PlayIntegrityFix_Analysis.md) - Analysis of PlayIntegrityFix approach
- [Technical Details](docs/technical_details.md) - Detailed technical information about our implementation

### How to Use This Documentation

1. **New Contributors**: Start with the Memory Bank, especially the Project Brief and Active Context
2. **Technical Understanding**: Review the analysis documents to understand the underlying mechanisms
3. **Current Work**: Check the Active Context and Progress documents for the latest development status
4. **Implementation Details**: Technical Details provides specific implementation approaches

## Ownership & Distribution

This project is maintained as a **private initiative** for the following reasons:

1. **Potential misuse**: This technology could be exploited for illegitimate purposes like fraud or bypassing security restrictions on banking apps
2. **Platform security**: If widely available, platform providers would quickly develop countermeasures
3. **Legal considerations**: There could be legal risks associated with circumventing system security mechanisms

### Legitimate Use Cases

The project focuses on the following legitimate use cases:
- Privacy protection and preventing device tracking
- Research into Android security mechanisms
- Testing application compatibility across different device profiles
- Educational purposes to understand system-level Android operations
