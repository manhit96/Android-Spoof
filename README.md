# Android-Spoof

A comprehensive Android device information spoofing solution integrated directly into LineageOS source code instead of using hooks like Xposed.

[English](README.md) | [Tiếng Việt](README_vi.md)

## Overview

Android-Spoof develops a solution to spoof Android device information through direct integration into LineageOS source code, creating a more stable and consistent system compared to existing hook-based solutions.

## Objectives

- Develop a comprehensive Android device information spoofing solution
- Integrate directly into LineageOS source code instead of using hooks (Xposed)
- Create a system capable of completely spoofing a device (brand, model, IMEI, MAC, etc.)
- Ensure consistency of all information to create valid fingerprints
- Bypass verification mechanisms such as Google Play Integrity and SafetyNet
- Research security mechanisms and system integrity verification methods

## Project Status

The project is currently in the **research phase**. We are focusing on analyzing existing projects and studying LineageOS source code to determine the optimal integration approach.
