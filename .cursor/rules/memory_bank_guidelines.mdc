# Project Memory Bank

*Inspired by [Cline Memory Bank](mdc:https:/docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/custom-instructions-library/cline-memory-bank)*

AI agents, including those with persistent memory and those without, benefit from a structured Memory Bank to maintain project context. This approach ensures continuity, consistency, and effective collaboration throughout the project lifecycle. By reading ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task, AI agents can maintain perfect context awareness.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of required core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]
    
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

### Act Mode
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules[Update Project Rules if needed]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Update Project Rules]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    
    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, the AI agent MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

## Project Intelligence (Project Rules)

The project rules file is a learning journal for each project. It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help AI agents work more effectively. As the project progresses, key insights that aren't obvious from the code alone are documented here.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start{Discover New Pattern}
    
    subgraph Learn [Learning Process]
        D1[Identify Pattern]
        D2[Validate with User]
        D3[Document in Project Rules]
    end
    
    subgraph Apply [Usage]
        A1[Read Project Rules]
        A2[Apply Learned Patterns]
        A3[Improve Future Work]
    end
    
    Start --> Learn
    Learn --> Apply
```

### What to Capture
- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow
- Project-specific patterns
- Known challenges
- Evolution of project decisions
- Tool usage patterns

The format is flexible - focus on capturing valuable insights that help AI agents work more effectively with the user and the project. Think of Project Rules as a living document that grows smarter as the project evolves.

REMEMBER: The Memory Bank is essential for maintaining context across sessions. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as the effectiveness of AI agents depends entirely on its accuracy.
